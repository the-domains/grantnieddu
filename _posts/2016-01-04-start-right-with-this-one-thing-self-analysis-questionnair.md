So, it's the new year. Honestly my second favorite holiday. Thanksgiving is full of gratitude AND good food. New Years comes in second only because the food is par for the course for the year.

But I love it so much because it is the time that most people are thinking about their life very seriously. Some may be thinking of trimming fat. Others may be thinking of major life changes. But most everyone (in the U.S. at least) are taking a deep honest look at their lives.

To be sure, they are thinking about goals, but they are often stumped on where to start with their goals. If we were to be honest, with each passing year, moving from December 31st to January 1st is just like any other day.

We definitely need deeper rituals around the idea of giving yourself a big enough restart to make massive improvements in your life. We definitely need more reliable community structure to create a feedback loop of our intentions. (Think of the social reinforcement on marriage. We declare our vows publicly. There is a \[now barely noticeable\] social shame if you back out of those commitments.)

A much easier place to start is in a solid personal self-review. We say that we review, but that usually ends up being a skim through past photos on Facebook or a clicking through your months in Google Calendar. The type of review I am speaking of should require you to pull out your journal or opening up a word document to type in. The type of review I am thinking of demands serious introspection.

I have done several over the years. Though I am prone to creating a Spark tool for most things, the self-analysis questionnaire I have landed on that has brought me the best results is the one from Napoleon Hill's 'Think and Grow Rich.' This is it in it's entirety for you to use.

Here are my instructions. Schedule an hour or two to yourself. This may be rare for many of you, but DO IT! Go to a coffee shop. Purchase your hot drink of choice. Put in your headset and put on music without lyrics. Open your journal. And, one by one, make your way through the following questions. I have added Spark Notes along the way to guide you a bit.

(For accountability, join our Spark Goals & Gratitude Group on Facebook and post to let us know that you did this, or at least some part of it!)

Self-Analysis Questionnaire:

1\. Have I attained the goal which I established as my objective for the year?

\*\* Do I even remember WHAT goal I established this year? If I do not, what plan will I implement to keep focused on the same goal throughout the year?

2\.
